# Vocab: Types

# Vocab: Values vs. Variables

**Values** have *types*

**Variables** do not... they just big signs that point to *values*
    * `var` defines *variables*
    * `=` assigns a *variable* to a *value*

---

# Vocab: Function

Functions are packaged up repeatable behavior.

Analogy: Recipe

Define vs. Invoke

Parts:

* Name
* Parameters/Arguments
* Return Value

---

# Vocab: Anonymous Function

Just a function without a name... Remember functions are just values!

```
function (x, y) {
	return x + y;
}
```

Remember values are lost unless it is assigned to a variable:

```
var add = function (x, y) {
	return x + y;
}
```

---

# Vocab: Expressions

Anything that resolves to a value

**Key Point**: Functions take in a return *values*
