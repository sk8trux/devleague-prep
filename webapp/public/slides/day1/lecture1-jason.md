# Basic Ideas

jsbin for coding by example?

# Start...

Missed the first hour and a half

jsbin

concatenation
(using + with a string will always result in a string)

int + int + string
vs.
string + int + int
vs.
string + (int + int)

Order of Operations

use of console.log to debug
just try stuff

verbalize questions and try stuff


slides.com/sgnl/js-basics

all comes down to variables and data

Get through slides by 8pm... then apply

# Functions

Repeatable behavior that we can package up
Give input and get output

* define
* invoke

Repeatable output (side effects? function vs. procedure)

The way we get repeatable code in our application
Encapsulate repeatable behavior

"reserved keywords"
"well-named" function
syntax for defining
invoking: "grabs the flow of control"

# Anonymous functions
function x() {}
vs.
var x = function() {}

Function is a valid data type (just like numbers and strings)

no input, no output -> just doing something (aka. side effect)

Emphasis of tonight: Variables and Functions
How we store data
How we implement behavior

# Now... Arguments and Parameters (two words mean the same thing)

* Declared with parameters (variables)
* Invoked with arguments (values)

parameters ARE variables
(function results ARE values)

need to capture the result

This is how we build software: Functions and Variables

# Return Values

No return values in JavaScript is undefined

# Objects

... skipping for now ...

# Expressions

... skipping for now ...

# Control Flow

Reads code line by line
What line is being evaluated at a given time (and what is the context?)

# Conditionals

... skipping for now ...



8pm break for 10min


# Download stuff

Editor: Sublime Text 3
Package Manager installation
Install SublimeLinter (and SublimeLinter-jshint)

# Setup

Make sure everyone is on Slack

Create a folder on desktop called devleague

What is Github and Git


# Exercise

Skeleton for the exercise is up on Github
Everyone copy/paste from github

https://github.com/devleague/prep-js-basics

jsbin to help


# Questions for Jason

* What are they using as an editor?
    * Sublime Text... What about Atom?
* Git?
* Code review?


# Lecture 2
Install iterm2

Introduction to the terminal

Git for Windows ->
Git Bash: Jason likes recommended checkout checkin settings

iterm2

"Mac built on top of Linux kernel... Good dev machine for open source world"

zshell

oh-my-zsh (prompts for xcode)

Node.js

client = web browser
server

* Good analogy for terminal vs iterm2
compared to bash vs zshell

Get the linter working
(sublime linter settings too)

# Function review

## Syntax Rules

1. Uses the funciton keywords
2. Is followed by name in (in most cases)
3. Function name is followed by parentheses
4. We "sometimes" have args/params inside out parentheses which are variables to our function
5. They have opening/closing curly braces

Vocab: concatenation

Emphasize capturing the return value of a function

all software is just functions and variables

## A lot of time to go through gist examples

> Trust the spacing of the exercises :)

## Github and git setup


# Next time

1. No more copying from jsbin back and forth from sublime
